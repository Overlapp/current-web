<ContentTitle>The Best Things in Life Are Free. The Second Best Things Take Time. Fortunately, Overlapp Is Both!    </ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
They say the best things in life are free: a sunset, laughter with friends, a great song on the radio. But what about the second best things? The ones that make life a little richer, a little more organized, a little more fun? Those take time—time to get right, time to build, and time to make sure they’re something truly worth waiting for.
<br></br>
At Overlapp, we’re creating a place that combines both.

A Digital Home That’s Worth the Wait

<ContentTitle>A Heartfelt Thank You to Our Testers</ContentTitle>

 We believe Overlapp will be the space you didn’t realize you were missing—a digital home where you can track all the cool things you want to do, from must-try restaurants and epic concerts to streamers and hidden gems. Most importantly, it’s where you’ll connect with the perfect people to share them with.

<ContentTitle>Sure, building this takes time (a little longer than we’d like, we admit). But here’s the good news:</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
    * When it’s ready, Overlapp will be free. No barriers, no nonsense—just a beautiful place to get your fun together.
    * It’s being built with care. We’re listening to feedback, learning what you love, and making sure Overlapp feels like the digital home you’ve always wanted.

<ContentTitle>The Wait Is Almost Over!</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
 We’re moving closer to our MVP every day, and we couldn’t have done it without the incredible feedback and support from our community (shout-out to our early testers! :raised_hands:).
So yes, the best things in life are free, and the second best things do take time. But trust us: Overlapp will be worth it.
