<ContentTitle>Sneak Peek: Amazing Cool Features We’re Cooking Up for the MVP</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
  As we dive into building the MVP, we’re excited about turning Overlapp into your new favorite digital home. Imagine this: instead of just bookmarking, saving, or adding a map pin, you can take a pic, screenshot, or use your voice to capture that must-do item. Then, our AI will transform it into a beautiful, shareable card. You can even see who else is interested in the same activities! It’s not just searchable—it’s something stunning, social, and totally sharable. We’re not making any promises just yet, but trust us, we’re working on some pretty awesome stuff!
