<ContentTitle>Are Overlapps the New Likes?</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
  In the world of social media, "likes" have long been the standard measure of engagement.<br></br> However, they often lack depth and don't foster real connections.<br></br> Overlapp is changing this by introducing "Overlapps"â€”a new way to engage that is both genuine and actionable.

<ContentTitle>Limitations of Traditional Likes</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
 - **Superficial Engagement:** Traditional likes are easy to give but often lack meaning. They don't indicate a true connection or interest beyond a simple click.
<br></br>
 - **Limited Utility:** Likes provide no actionable insight. They don't help individuals organize activities or connect over shared interests in a meaningful way.

<ContentTitle>The Overlapp Solution</ContentTitle>
<ContentText>
  **What is an Overlapp?** An Overlapp occurs when your interests and activities align with someone else's on the platform. Itâ€™s more than just a likeâ€”it's a signal that you share common interests and can potentially connect over them.
<br></br>
    **Overlapps Happen:** Genuine connections naturally arise from your interests and activities. Overlapp is the place for all the things you like, dislike, and want to do. Overlapps just naturally arise out of your true feelings.
<br></br>
   **Enhanced Social Interaction:** Overlapps enhance social interactions by focusing on shared activities and interests, rather than just passive engagement.
<br></br>
**Privacy and Control:** Overlapp prioritizes your privacy and control, ensuring your data is secure and you decide what to share. You can discover others who share your interests while staying anonymous if you prefer. If you choose to share, you can connect through direct messages. Private individuals remain anonymous but are still recognized for sharing your tastes.
<br></br>
    We believe Overlapps are genuine and actionable. They enhance social interactions, improve planning, and offer robust privacy features.
